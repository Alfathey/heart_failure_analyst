# heart_failure_analyst

This repository serves as a hub for information and analysis on heart failure, delving into predicting death events based on various significant features. Through the available data, users can explore the relationships between variables such as age, gender, and smoking history with these fatal occurrences. The analysis aims to provide better insights into the risk factors involved in heart failure, which in turn can aid in further prevention and management efforts regarding this condition.

# Features Utilized
The analysis utilizes the following features:

1.Age: Age of the patient.
2.Anaemia: Indicates whether the patient has anaemia (0 for no, 1 for yes).
3.Creatinine Phosphokinase: Level of the enzyme creatinine phosphokinase in the blood (mcg/L).
4.Diabetes: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (0 for no, 1 for yes).
5.Ejection Fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (%).
6.High Blood Pressure: Indicates whether the patient has high blood pressure (0 for no, 1 for yes).
7.Platelets: Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL).
8.Serum Creatinine: Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL).
9.Serum Sodium: Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L).
10.Sex: Gender of the patient (0 for female, 1 for male).
11.Smoking: Indicates whether the patient smokes (0 for no, 1 for yes).
12.Time: Follow-up period (days).
